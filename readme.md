#WikiX
by David Wilbanks

...is my capstone project from the [bloc.io](http://www.bloc.io) **Full Stack Web Development** course
(and it will get a decent name when I think of one).

A quick video demo will be available at [www.davidwilbanks.net](www.davidwilbanks.net) in early March 2015.

###The Requirements

1. As a user, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email.
1. As a user, I want to be able to sign in and out of the WikiX.
1. As a user with a standard (free) account, I want to create, read, update, and delete public wikis which anyone can view.
1. User accounts should have one of two roles: standard (free), or premium.
1. As a developer, I want the development database to be automatically seeded with users and wikis.
1. As a user I want upgrade my account from a free plan to a paid (premium) plan.
1. As a user with a premium account, I want to create private wikis which require a wikiX account and proper authorization to view.
1. As a user, I want to edit wikis using Markdown syntax.
1. As a user with a premium account, I want to add and remove collaborators to my private wikis.

So yeah it does all that. And it has flashing lights.
